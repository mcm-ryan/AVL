# AVL Tree
This repository contains the Python code for an AVL tree. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. My Data Structures professor, Brian Ricks, provided me the "printExt.p"y file for testing purposes.
